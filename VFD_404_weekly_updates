Weekly TA Updates

Jan 16
Mackenzie: 
  Since 403 - went over original design
  Next week - redesign and order pcb - organize and order new parts

Andrew:
  Since 403 - WEnt over necessary components and what connections needed to be changed
  Next week - redesign and order pcb

Aidan: 
  Since 403 - 403 to 404 transition (organize teams files, github files)
  Next week - complete order 4; work on status update 1 presentation; work on validation plan; work on FSR v1; work on PCB v1

Ryan:
  Since 403 - Communicated with Drew about necessary components on microcontroller PCB
  Next week - Fix frequency of PWM waves to range from 10Hz to 60Hz, fix voltage to be 120V, figure out how to demonstrate the output onto a load resistor

Jan 23
Mackenzie: 
  This week - redesigned pcb - discussion about physical orientation for integration - add validations test
  Next week - route pcb

Andrew:
  This week - began work on PCB redesign
  Next week - complete PCB and order

Aidan: 
  This week - 403 to 404 transition (organize teams files, github files); worked on status update 1 presentation; system design review 1
  Next week - complete order 4; complete status update 1 presentation; work on validation plan; work on FSR v1; work on PCB v1

Ryan:
  This week - Found temporary frequency fix. Am now able to scale and calibrate the frequencies based on the number I assign a variable.
  Next week - Figure out how to view the PWM sine waves on oscilloscope. Attempt integration with Optoelectronics.

Jan 30
Mackenzie: 
  This week - routed pcb completely 
  Next week - order pcb and parts

Andrew:
  This week - Ordered PCB, completed status update 1 presentation.
  Next week - 

Aidan: 
  This week - completed status update 1 presentation; completed full design review; worked on PCB v1
  Next week - complete PCBv1 order; complete order 4; work on Auxiliary Power Integration; work on validation plan; work on FSR v1

Ryan:
  This week - Partially successful integration with Optoelectronics subsystem. Found out how to produce 3.3V to power optoelectronics PCB.
  Next week - Figure out how to produce/visualize sine waves of PWM waves on oscilloscope. Find out how to power Dev board without laptop.

Feb 6
Mackenzie: 
  This week - ordered pcb - picked out parts 
  Next week - populate board 

Andrew:
  This week - 
  Next week - 

Aidan: 
  This week - completed PCBv1 order; worked on order 4
  Next week - complete order 4; complete status update 2 presentation; work on PCBv1 assembly; work on Auxiliary Power Integration

Ryan:
  This week - Figured out how to produce/visualize sine waves of PWM waves on oscilloscope. Found out how to power Dev board with 5V supply.
  Next week - Once the new optoelectronics PCB arrives, make another attempt at integration.

  Next week - 

Aidan: 
  This week - completed order 4; completed status update 2 presentation; worked on PCBv1 assembly; worked on Auxiliary Power Integration
  Next week - complete PCBv1 assembly; complete Auxiliary Power Integration; work on PWM Control Integration; work on Relay Control Integration

Ryan:
  This week - Integrated with optoelectronics subsystem by sending all 6 PWM signals through their PCB and displaying the same output on their end.
  Next week - Implement start/stop button that starts and shuts off the PWM wave production. Integrate with the microcontroller and power subsystems' PCBs once they are done soldering.
