"Your project should have a README file that explains the project and what is contained in the repository"

Traditional motor control systems cannot adjust to varying load demands, resulting in poor energy efficiency, excessive heat generation, and premature component failure​. ​Our project is to develop a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) motor control system to adjust frequency and voltage to load demands​. 

This github repository includes altium files, firmware code files, presentations pdfs, and report pdfs to act as a backup of our progess in the event of an emergency.
