"Your project should have a README file that explains the project and what is contained in the repository"

Traditional motor control systems cannot adjust to varying load demands, resulting in poor energy efficiency, excessive heat generation, and premature component failure​. 
​Our project is to develop a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) motor control system to adjust frequency and voltage to load demands​. 
The github repository that we created includes schematics, PCB routes, and the code that was used throughout our project so that we may not lose progress if something happens.
